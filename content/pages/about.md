## Welcome 

I'm a **Python** Backend Developer by trade. **Django** is my preferred web framework. I mostly write **API**s in **DRF** or **Django-Ninja**. 

At work we do **DevOps** with **microservices** in **AWS** with **Docker**, **Docker Swarm** and **K8S**. Building, testing and deploying via **CI/CD** through **GitHub**, **Jenkins** and **Travis**. I use **Linux** and **OSX** for everything.

This blog is for my own personal use, mostly for remembering stuff which I probably would forget otherwise. 

Having to explain techy stuff in text after you successfully tried something out makes another round-trip to the brain which helps with "permanent" brain storage.

Articles may not be posted as frequently as one would wish, it's because i'm a father of three, living in an old house with renovation needs, a garage full of old stuff that also requires attention and a busy schedule overall.

But, if you happen to find something useful here - great! Use at your own reponsibility.
